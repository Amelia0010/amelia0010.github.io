On the 27th of June, we took a delayed flight from ORD, Chicago to LGA, New York City, where we stayed at the Millenium Hilton at the UN Plaza. 
Before dozing off, I got this lovely picture with the first UN Flag I've ever seen in real life, as well as the stars and stripes and the flag of New York.
The picture ended up great, as a gust of air came in right as we took it.

After taking a brisk walk to a mostly empty 7AM Times Square, we went to Angelina's at Herald Square to have breakfast. I did my absolute utmost
to cut a massive chocolate covered donut in two (not very equal) parts with the ends of two plastic forks, lacking knives and the tips of the forks being too soft and bendy.

We then walked further south, going past the Empire State Building, through Madison and Washington Square Parks (I saw an incredibly photogenic squirrel!), all the way down
Broadway and into the Financial District.
