As of right now, this website is 2 red bars (a header and a footer, with the former also functioning as a navbar).
It consists of exactly 4 pages, a main page, a contact page, an about page, and my list of ramblings.

The site is, to be entirely honest with you, god-awful. It's ugly, it was bashed together in a depression-fuelled
spree of energy directed at making <i>something</i> that would be able to house my emotional ramblings and thoughts.
Not necessarily because others should be able to see it, but so that I can just blast them out into the nothingness
and not direct them at anyone in particular, in the vain hope that I will be less of a burden on those around me if
I can keep these things vaguely to myself.

So yeah, that's why this site is so basic right now. Because it's meant primarily just for being the home of my 
ever-increasing derangement.
